                <h2 class="MiniHeading">Taekwondo :</h2>

                <p style="margin-left: 55px;">
                    Taekwondo is a korean martial art and combat sport that heavily <b>emphasizes kicking techniques</b>.<br>
                    Unlike karate and other martial arts Taekwondo has both body and head protection meaning there is<br>
                    <b>no restriction on power during fights</b> like karate does.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-left: 55px;">
                    I started Taekwondo in <b>2017</b> as a hobby in school and participated in a <b>district tournament just two weeks</b><br>
                    after joining, <b>securing a silver medal</b>. Since only gold medalists qualified for the state level, I missed that opportunity.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-left: 55px;">
                    Determined to improve, I trained rigorously for a year and returned to district competitions, <b>advancing up to the<br>
                    zonal level</b>, where I lost in the first round. I then participated in two more district tournaments, winning gold in both,<br>
                    though I couldn’t continue further due to academic commitments and distant venues.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-left: 55px;">
                    When the pandemic hit, I took a nearly two-year break. Upon returning in 2021, I competed in multiple district tournaments,<b> winning<br>
                    all of them</b>. After these three golds, I have now won <b>seven district tournaments consecutively and advanced to two state-level<br>
                    competitions, a zonal, and a national tournament</b>, including <b>two knockout victories where my opponents were knocked unconscious</b>.<br>
                    During this period, I also <b>passed my black belt test on the first attempt</b>.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-left: 55px;">
                    Although I have now stopped regular practice, I still participate in tournaments whenever circumstances allow. Below is a summary <br>
                    of my acheivements in Taekwondo.
