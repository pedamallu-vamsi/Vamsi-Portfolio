        <p>
            Hello World! My name is <b>Vamsi</b>. I was born in <b>Bhimavaram</b>, a small town in the West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh.<br>
            Because of my dad’s profession, I moved cities often during my childhood, but we eventually settled in Vijayawada, where <br>
            I have lived for over 10 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m passionate about sports such as <b>Taekwondo, Swimming, Athletics, Cricket, Badminton,</b> and more. I also enjoy watching <br>
            movies and series in multiple languages including Telugu, Hindi, English, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese. 
        </p>
        <p>I completed most of my schooling in Vijayawada and actively participated in Taekwondo competitions. I am a <b>National Taekwondo
            Player, a 7-time District Gold Medalist, and have played the Zonal Championships twice</b>, along with many other<br>
            achievements (which you can see <a href="#" class="Olink">here</a>). 
        </p>
        <p>
            I completed my Intermediate at Narayana Junior College, Vijayawada. I qualified both JEE Mains and JEE Advanced, and secured<br>
             a <b>rank of 1866 in AP EAMCET</b>. I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in <b>Computer Science and Engineering</b> at the<br> <b>Indian Institute of Information Technology, Kottayam </b>through
             my JEE Mains rank. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I take a strong interest in <b>Data Structures & Algorithms, Competitive Programming, and Web Development</b>. I regularly solve problems
        on LeetCode, where I have <b>solved nearly 100 questions and maintain an 85-day streak</b>. You can check my <a href="https://leetcode.com/u/Vamsi-Pedamallu/" class="Olink">LeetCode profile here</a>.
        I also actively participate in coding contests that push me to think faster and improve consistently, and challenge myself.
        </p>
        <p> 
        As I continue learning and building new projects, I aim to grow into a skilled engineer who can solve real-world problems with creativity
        and precision. This portfolio represents where I am today, and the journey I’m excited to continue.
